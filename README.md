# Boris Bikes

Week 1 Challenge to build a program that will emulate all the docking stations, bikes, and infrastructure (repair staff, and so on) required to create a network of docking stations and bikes that anyone can use. The project is broken up into 22 challenges.

This challenge will help me towards these goals:
- I grow collaboratively
- I can model anything
- I can TDD anything

## Action Plan

More info about the challenge can be found here: https://github.com/makersacademy/course/tree/master/boris_bikes

## Evidence Plan
I will be able to answer yes to the following questions:
- I can diagram and explain my TDD process to my peers and/or a coach
- I have collected feedback from my peers about how I am as a pair partner that shows I am improving

## Pairing
On the first day of the challenge, I paired with Alec Walker. We got through steps 1 - 9.
The following day I paired with Sid Mason-Malik and we worked through steps 10 - 12.
On Thursday, I paired with Roberta Mangiapane and we got through steps 13 - 16.
