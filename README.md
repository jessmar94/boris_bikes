# Boris Bikes

Week 1 Challenge to build a program that will emulate all the docking stations, bikes, and infrastructure (repair staff, and so on) required to create a network of docking stations and bikes that anyone can use. The project is broken up into 22 challenges.

This challenge will help me towards these goals:
- I grow collaboratively
- I can model anything
- I can TDD anything

## Action Plan

More info about the challenge can be found here: https://github.com/makersacademy/course/tree/master/boris_bikes

We started the Boris Bikes challenge on Tuesday of Week 1. There were 22 steps in total for this challenge. If on one day you paired with someone who was a few steps behind you, you were to start from where they got to. 

## Evidence Plan
I will be able to answer yes to the following questions:
- I can diagram and explain my TDD process to my peers and/or a coach
- I have collected feedback from my peers about how I am as a pair partner that shows I am improving

> 17.09.19 - Pairing feedback from Alec Walker: You had good communication throughout the session. We could have taken a more structured approach to pairing.

> 18.09.19 - Pairing feedback from Sid Maison-Malik: You stuck to the TDD process well but we could both have been stricter with making sure only one navigator/driver at a time, making sure we swap regardless if we've made progress on problem. I found you easy going to work with and you always ensured we were going back to write the correct most basic test before trying to code the solution.

> 19.09.19 - Pairing feedback from Roberta Mangiapane: You were patient and collaborative. You explained to me clearly and kindly the things I couldn't understand or remember. You carried out the concepts you already know with confidence and you were proactive, in searching sources for new concepts. I didn't feel rushed and I was comfortable to ask you for help, suggestions or explanation. Next time, try to be more patient with yourself. 

> 20.09.19 - Pairing feedback from Vijay Kurian: You had good communication and were willing to adopt an approach different than your first instinct. You could have perhaps slowed down a bit in terms of jumping straight to rspec before the feature test. However, your approach to Feature testing improved as we progressed through the session.

## Project Status 
- On Day 1 of the challenge, I paired with Alec Walker and we completed steps 1-9 on [my repo](https://github.com/jessmar94/boris_bikes).
- On Day 2 of the challenge, I paired with Sid Mason-Malik and we completed steps 10 - 12 on my repo.
- On Day 3 of the challengey, I paired with Roberta Mangiapane and we completed steps 13 - 16 on my repo.
- On Day 4 of the challenge, I paired with Vijay Kurian and we completed steps 13 - 17 on [his repo](https://github.com/kurianvijay/boris_bikes2).
